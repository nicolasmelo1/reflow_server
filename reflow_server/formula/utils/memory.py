        Each row is called a record. a Record is exactly this class.

        It have a name and a type, is it a function? Is it a method? Is it the program?
        And the name is the name of the function, or program, or whatever. It is just an identifier.

class Memory:

    This is the memory. It is a virtual memory, of course not the actual hardware memory in the computer.

    The idea is super super simple: The memory controls the CallStack.
    OH, You've never learned about CallStack? Okay i will try to explain.

    Let's program in python for the sake of this example, so suppose the following code:

    >>> def subtraction(a, b):
            return a - b

    >>> def sum(a, b):
            return a + b

    >>> print(subtraction(2,1))
        print(sum(1,2))

    What happens when we do this? Yup, it prints 1 and 3, you've got it.
    But how this works under the hood?

    "WHAT THE HELL?"

    So what does it do? First we start the program, when we start the program we add this hole script to the call stack.
    Understand the program as the "GLOBAL". You know global variables and all that stuff? This is what the Program holds, all
    variables available fo the hole program to use.

    Okay, so what comes next? This program will hold the variables sum and subtraction, understand 'sum' as a string
    and 'subtraction' as a string. Both strings are keys of dictionary, and both 'sum' and 'subtraction' are functions.

    it's something like:
    >>> {
        'sum': lambda a, b: a + b,
        'subtraction': lambda a, b: a - b
    }

    Okay so what happens next is that first we call 'subtraction' function, this function is added to the call stack, the value 
    is returned and then it is poped from the call stack (we've already used the function)

    The same happens when we call 'sum', the function is added to the call stack, all the variables from the previous record become
    available for us to use inside of the function and we enable 'a' and 'b' for usage.

    This might sound too complex, but it's not

    >>> x = 2
    def sum(a):
        return a + x
    print(a)

    What happens when we run this?
    It gives an error, right, can you point where?

    Exactly, on `print(a)`. But Why?? Because the variable 'a' is available ONLY inside of the function when the function is running.
    But why "a + x" works? Exacly, because everything from the outer scope is available inside of the function.

    Okay, so let's continue: notice how a and b only exists while the sum and 'subtraction' are running, but when they are removed, both
    variables doesn't exist anymore.

    That's the hole idea of the call stack, the call stack is a stack (FILO (first in, last out)) as the name suggests, so whatever
    is at the BOTTOM of the stack is the record we are in. In the 3ยบ phase look that 'sum' is in the last position of the stack
    so this is what is being runned at the moment.

    When we finish running this we remove this from the stack and go back to the latest record from the stack.

    With this information, can you understand how a recursion works?
